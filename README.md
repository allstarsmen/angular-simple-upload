# Angular Simple Upload File

An angular module for file uploads. A simple skeleton that you can easily add to, no extra features, just easy to style upload button.

## About the project
Due to [Angular Material UI](https://material.angular.io/) does not support the File upload, I decide to build one based on [their article](https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-file-upload/).

This project was built for fun and to learn how to create a library in Angular.

- Node.js version 18.15
- NPM version 9.5.0

- Angular Material UI Version 15
